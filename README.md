``` 

## SIPp command line options:

Following a list of the most common command line options. You can obtain the full list executing the command `sipp -h`.

##### Scenario options

* `-sn <scenario>`: use a builtin scenario (*uas*, *uac*, *regexp*, ...)
* `-sd <scenario>`: dump the XML implementing the builtin scenario
* `-sf <scenario-file>`: load a custom scenario file
* `-set <var> <val>`: set the variable *var* with *val* value, the variable can then used into the scenario file as `[$var]`

##### SIP IP address and port

* `-i <local_ip>`: set the local IP address for the *Contact*, *Via* and *From* headers, can be referenced with `[local_ip]` keyword into a scenario file. Applies to the SIP protocol only.
* `-p <local_port>`: set the local port for the SIP protocol. Can be referenced using the `[local_port]`keyword.

##### Media and RTP options

* `-mi <media_ip>`: set the local media IP address, this value can also be referred using the `[media_ip]` keyword into the scenario file
* `-mp <media_port>`: set the local media port, this value can also be referred using the `[media_port]` keyword into the scenario file
* `-rtp_echo`: Enable RTP echo. RTP/UDP packets received on port defined by -mp are echoed to their sender.

##### Call rate options

* `-l <max_calls>`: set the maximum number of simultaneous calls
* `-m <calls>`: Stop the test and exit when *calls* calls are processed

##### Tracing and logging options

* `-trace_msg`: dump sent and received SIP messages in `<scenario_file_name>_<pid>_messages.log`
* `-message_file`: Set the name of the message log file
* `-trace_err`: trace all unexpected messages in `<scenario_file_name>_<pid>_errors.log`
* `-error_file`: set the name of the error log file
* `-trace_logs`: allow tracing of <log> actions in `<scenario_file_name>_<pid>_logs.log`
* `-log_file`: set the name of the log actions log file

## SIPp scenario file syntax

* root XML tag is named **scenario** and must have the **name** attribute:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <scenario name="Basic UAC custom scenario">
      <!-- here your scenario -->
    </scenario>
    ```

### Scenario commands

Here is a lost of the most important scenario commands:

* `<send>`: send a SIP message or a response. Important attributes are:
    * `retrans`: set the T1 timer for this message in milliseconds
    * `lost`: emulate packet lost, value in percentage

* `<recv>`: wait for a SIP message or response. Important attributes are:
    * `response`: indicates what SIP message code is expected
    * `request`: indicates what SIP message request is expected
    * `optional`: Indicates if the message to receive is optional. If optional is set to "global", SIPp will look every previous steps of the scenario
    * `lost`: emulate packet lost, value in percentage
    * `timeout`: specify a timeout while waiting for a message. If the message is not received, the call is aborted
    * `ontimeout`: specify a label to jump to if the timeout popped
regexp_match: boolean. Indicates if 'request' ('response' is not available) is given as a regular expression.

    The `recv` command can also include the action tag defining the action to execute upon the message reception

* `pause`: pause the scenario execution. Important attributes are:
    * `milliseconds`: time to pause in milliseconds
    * `variable`: scenario variable defining the pause time

* `nop`: the `nop` action doesnâ€™t do nothing at SIP signalling level, is just a tag containing the `action` subtag

* `sendCmd`: content to be sent to the twin 3PCC (3rd Party Call Control) SIPp instance. The Call-ID must be included

* `recvCmd`: specify an action when receiving the command

* `label`: a label is used when you want to branch to specific parts in your scenarios

#### Common command attributes

Here is a list of attributes common to all the scenario commands:

* `crlf`: Displays an empty line after the arrow for the message in main SIPp screen
* `next`: You can put a "next" in any command element to go to another part of the script when you are done with sending the message. For optional receives, the next is only taken if that message was received
* `test`: You can put a "test" next to a "next" attribute to indicate that you only want to branch to the label specified with "next" if the variable specified in "test" is set
* `display`: Display a text into the SIPp screen


### Scenario keywords

Inside the `send` command, you have to enclose your SIP message between the `<![CDATA` and the `]]>` tags.

Everything between those tags is going to be sent toward the remote system.
Into the SIP message you can include some keywords (Eg. `[service]`, `[remote_ip]`, etc..).

Those keywords will get replaced at runtime by SIPp.

* `[service]`: service field, as passed in the -s <service_name> command line option (default: service)
* `[remote_ip]` and `[remote_port]`: remote IP address and port
* `[transport]`: the transport mode (depending on the -t CLI parameter) (default: UDP)
* `[local_ip]`, `[local_ip_type]`, `[local_port]`: depending on the `-l` and `-p` CLI params. Type can be **4** or **6**
* `[len]`: computed length of the SIP body. To be used in *Content-Length* header
* `[cseq]`: generates automatically the *CSeq* number
* `[call_id]`: a call_id identifies a call and is generated by SIPp for each new call. In client mode, it is mandatory to use the value generated by SIPp in the *Call-ID* header
* `[media_ip]`, `[media_ip_type]`, `[media_port]`: depending on the value of *-mi* and *-mp* params.
* `[last_*]`: is replaced automatically by the specified header if it was present in the last message received (Eg. `[last_From]`)

### Scenario actions

In a `recv`, `recvCmd` or `nop` command you can execute one or more actions:

* `ereg`: execute a regular expression matching
* `log`: write a log message
* `exec`: execute a command on the operating system shell, or an internal SIPp command or play a pcap file
* `jump`: jump to an arbitrary scenario index

*** Injection file options:

   -inf             : Inject values from an external CSV file during calls into the scenarios.
                      First line of this file say whether the data is to be read in sequence
                      (SEQUENTIAL), random (RANDOM), or user (USER) order.
                      Each line corresponds to one call and has one or more ';' delimited data
                      fields. Those fields can be referred as [field0], [field1], ... in the xml
                      scenario file.  Several CSV files can be used simultaneously (syntax: -inf
                      f1.csv -inf f2.csv ...)
   -infindex        : file field
                      Create an index of file using field.  For example -inf users.csv -infindex
                      users.csv 0 creates an index on the first key.
   -ip_field        : Set which field from the injection file contains the IP address from which
                      the client will send its messages.
                      If this option is omitted and the '-t ui' option is present, then field 0 is
                      assumed.
                      Use this option together with '-t ui'

*** RTP behaviour options:

   -mi              : Set the local media IP address (default: local primary host IP address)
   -rtp_echo        : Enable RTP echo. RTP/UDP packets received on port defined by -mp are echoed
                      to their sender.
                      RTP/UDP packets coming on this port + 2 are also echoed to their sender
                      (used for sound and video echo).
   -mb              : Set the RTP echo buffer size (default: 2048).

                      pressing '+' key to increase call rate by 1 * rate_scale,
                      pressing '-' key to decrease call rate by 1 * rate_scale,
                      pressing '*' key to increase call rate by 10 * rate_scale,
                      pressing '/' key to decrease call rate by 10 * rate_scale.

   -rp              : Specify the rate period for the call rate.  Default is 1 second and default
                      unit is milliseconds.  This allows you to have n calls every m milliseconds
                      (by using -r n -rp m).
                      Example: -r 7 -rp 2000 ==> 7 calls every 2 seconds.
                               -r 10 -rp 5s => 10 calls every 5 seconds.
   -rate_scale      : Control the units for the '+', '-', '*', and '/' keys.
   -rate_increase   : Specify the rate increase every -fd units (default is seconds).  This allows
                      you to increase the load for each independent logging period.
                      Example: -rate_increase 10 -fd 10s
                        ==> increase calls by 10 every 10 seconds.
   -rate_max        : If -rate_increase is set, then quit after the rate reaches this value.
                      Example: -rate_increase 10 -rate_max 100
                        ==> increase calls by 10 until 100 cps is hit.
   -no_rate_quit    : If -rate_increase is set, do not quit after the rate reaches -rate_max.
   -l               : Set the maximum number of simultaneous calls. Once this limit is reached,
                      traffic is decreased until the number of open calls goes down. Default:
                        (3 * call_duration (s) * rate).
   -m               : Stop the test and exit when 'calls' calls are processed
   -users           : Instead of starting calls at a fixed rate, begin 'users' calls at startup,
                      and keep the number of calls constant.

*** Retransmission and timeout options:

   -recv_timeout    : Global receive timeout. Default unit is milliseconds. If the expected message
                      is not received, the call times out and is aborted.
   -send_timeout    : Global send timeout. Default unit is milliseconds. If a message is not sent
                      (due to congestion), the call times out and is aborted.
   -timeout         : Global timeout. Default unit is seconds.  If this option is set, SIPp quits
                      after nb units (-timeout 20s quits after 20 seconds).
   -timeout_error   : SIPp fails if the global timeout is reached is set (-timeout option
                      required).
   -max_retrans     : Maximum number of UDP retransmissions before call ends on timeout.  Default
                      is 5 for INVITE transactions and 7 for others.
   -max_invite_retrans: Maximum number of UDP retransmissions for invite transactions before call
                      ends on timeout.
   -max_non_invite_retrans: Maximum number of UDP retransmissions for non-invite transactions before call
                      ends on timeout.
   -nr              : Disable retransmission in UDP mode.
   -rtcheck         : Select the retransmission detection method: full (default) or loose.
   -T2              : Global T2-timer in milli seconds

*** Third-party call control options:

   -3pcc            : Launch the tool in 3pcc mode ("Third Party call control"). The passed IP
                      address depends on the 3PCC role.
                      - When the first twin command is 'sendCmd' then this is the address of the
                        remote twin socket.  SIPp will try to connect to this address:port to send
                        the twin command (This instance must be started after all other 3PCC
                        scenarios).
                          Example: 3PCC-C-A scenario.
                      - When the first twin command is 'recvCmd' then this is the address of the
                        local twin socket. SIPp will open this address:port to listen for twin
                        command.
                          Example: 3PCC-C-B scenario.
   -master          : 3pcc extended mode: indicates the master number
   -slave           : 3pcc extended mode: indicates the slave number
   -slave_cfg       : 3pcc extended mode: indicates the file where the master and slave addresses
                      are stored

*** Performance and watchdog options:

   -timer_resol     : Set the timer resolution. Default unit is milliseconds.  This option has an
                      impact on timers precision.Small values allow more precise scheduling but
                      impacts CPU usage.If the compression is on, the value is set to 50ms. The

Signal handling:

   SIPp can be controlled using POSIX signals. The following signals
   are handled:
   USR1: Similar to pressing the 'q' key. It triggers a soft exit
         of SIPp. No more new calls are placed and all ongoing calls
         are finished before SIPp exits.
         Example: kill -SIGUSR1 732
   USR2: Triggers a dump of all statistics screens in
         <scenario_name>_<pid>_screens.log file. Especially useful
         in background mode to know what the current status is.
         Example: kill -SIGUSR2 732

Exit codes:

   Upon exit (on fatal error or when the number of asked calls (-m
   option) is reached, SIPp exits with one of the following exit
   code:
    0: All calls were successful
    1: At least one call failed
   97: Exit on internal command. Calls may have been processed
   99: Normal exit without calls processed
   -1: Fatal error
   -2: Fatal error binding a socket
```
